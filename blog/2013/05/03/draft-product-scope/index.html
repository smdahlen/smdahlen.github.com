<div class="entry-content"><p>With an <a href="http://shawn.dahlen.me/blog/2013/04/12/manage-all-application-environments-with-vagrant/">operational approach</a> for managing my environment established, I
shifted my attention toward drafting product scope over the past few weeks.
This post outlines the core product features and acceptance criteria that will
be referenced during the upcoming design and development activities.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As I mentioned in my second <a href="http://shawn.dahlen.me/blog/2013/03/05/prepare-business-operations/">post</a>, I will be implementing a task management
product that provides first-class support for the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>. One
of the aspects of the technique that I find intriguing is the use of data to
review progress and provide motivation for continued success. For those who
have dabbled with personal productivity solutions over the years, it would come
as no surprise that sticking with a solution is hard. Without continued use,
positive habits never form and the expected productivity gains are never
realized. With my product, I intend to leverage the data collected from the
Pomodoro Technique to create a positive feedback loop motivating the individual
to modify their behavior over time.</p>

<p>To begin, I established the product goal for Marinara (the working name) as a
tool to increase personal productivity and assist in managing expectations
(with yourself, boss, or client).</p>

<p>Next, I crisply defined the core high-level features that would support the
product goal:</p>

<ol>
<li>A proven <strong>workflow</strong> based on the Pomodoro Technique that enhances your focus
and concentration to complete complex, creative projects.</li>
<li>Challenging <strong>gameplay</strong> that offers a sustainable path towards mastery of
the technique.</li>
<li>In-depth <strong>statistics and charts</strong> that increases awareness of your actions
to support effective decision making.</li>
</ol>


<p>Finally, I brainstormed, drafted, and revised a set of user stories and
acceptance criteria supporting the high-level features. Much time was given to
both creating a set of compelling game elements and ensuring testability of the
entire scope. The scope is succinct and intended as a foundation for creating
the user experience design &#8211; little attention was paid to drafting copy for
end users either as a manual or marketing material.</p>

<p>Without much further adieu here is the scope for Marinara &#8211; <em>a product that
helps you tackle your creative project and have fun doing it</em>.</p>
