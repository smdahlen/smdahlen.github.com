<div class="entry-content"><p>This post discusses my challenge to work smarter, not longer, and the path that
led me to build 4dashes &mdash; a productivity tool inspired by the Pomodoro
Technique.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Frustration was mounting. I wanted continued success at work without
sacraficing the value I place on family. Within the span of a few years, my
responsibilities had increased significantly from an associate software
engineer to a program manager overseeing multiple projects. Naturally, the
pressure to work longer came with it &mdash; in fact, our culture demanded it &mdash; the
number of hours we worked was viewed as a badge of honor.
Frustration was mounting indeed.</p>

<p>As a newly minted manager, my first inclination was to become more organized.
It seemed rational. The more organized I was the more in-control I felt. I tried
several productivity tools based on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">GTD</a>. They worked wonders for organizing
my work but did little to help get things actually done. My inbox was zero but my
todo list was a mile long. It seemed like I had to reset myself every few weeks
to regain the illusion of control I craved.</p>

<p>After repeating this nasty cycle more times than I care to admit, I reflected on
the situation and realized that my old work habits were becoming an impediment.
With less responsibility, I was able to deliver <em>perfect</em> results while still
handily supporting interruptions and socialization with colleagues.
But as my workload increased, this became untenable.</p>

<p>The time I dedicated to delivering results was squeezed by an increasingly
interrupt-driven work environment and I let it happen. Looking back,
it makes sense. Constantly responding to email, helping colleagues, and
putting out fires creates a short-term reward loop that is tough to break.
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand that much of this comes with accepting more
responsibility. I simply refused to fall into this trap that so many around me
did. I sought new work habits that would assist in setting limits so I could
focus on what was important.</p>

<p>When I came across the concept of the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/08/kick-procrastinations-ass-run-a-dash">productivity dash</a>, and later, the
<a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro Technique</a>, I was immediately drawn in by the power and simplicity
of the timebox. Select an important task to focus on and work on it
uninterrupted for a small duration of time. By doing so, you become more
mindful of the triggers for interruption and develop strategies to handle
them effectively.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, changing habits is hard. While recording the completion of
a dash or pomodoro does brings a small sense of accomplishment, I started
brainstorming about gamification techniques that could be applied to the
concept of a timebox. The objective was to replicate a compelling reward
loop facilitated by challenges and leaderboards that would build a
sustainable path towards mastery. The result was the product of my recent
startup, <a href="https://4dashes.com">4dashes</a>.</p>

<p>4dashes is a productivity tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique that
transforms your todo list into a game challenging you build more effective
work habits. Habits that enable you to plan and accomplish important work
in the face of urgent and unexpected activities. And with that in hand,
you gain the power of truely managing expectations and the satisfaction it
brings.</p>
