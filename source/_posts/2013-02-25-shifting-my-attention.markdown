After ten years working at Lockeed Martin I decided to leave my job and
and pursue a startup. The decision did not come easy. I left behind
colleagues, mentors, and leaders who had become my extended family. With
their trust and support, I have grown tremendously as a professional improving
my technical, mangerial, and leadership skills. However, a growing sense
of dissatisfaction had crept into my life which are attributed to learning
a few lessons during this period.

Lessons
-------

1. *Money and achievements do not bring lasting satisfaction.*
   I had the fortune to receive an excellent college education and a job
   opportunity right out of school. I worked hard and took advantage of the
   increasing levels of responsibility offered to me. In return my salary
   grew threefold and I notched many project successes and promotions on my
   belt. However, much like buying a new toy, earning more money or receiving
   the next promotion offered fleeting happiness. I found that if your sense of
   worth becomes too closely tied to your career, it can consume your attention
   leaving an insatiable thirst for more.

2. *Your attention is the most valuable thing you have.*
   Having your first child is a surefire way to gain perspective! When my son
   was born, I became acutely aware of the importance of my attention and how
   the quality of time spent with him was directly related to my engagement in
   the moment. Conversely, spreading my attention thin was a recipe for
   mediocrity and unhappiness. For a while, I tried to do it all: put in long
   hours at work, exercise, spend quality time with my wife and son, and tinker
   with open source projects. Nothing received my best. It became clear that I
   needed to set limits on where I placed my attention so I could increase my
   focus on what I valued most -- family and entrepreneurship.

3. *Failure contains the seeds of opportunity.*
   Since I was a child, I have had a love of learning nurtured by my mother
   and an interest for self-employment reflected by my father. I've desired
   to launch my own software business where I had the opportunity to employ
   multiple skills including product and project management, design,
   engineering, operations, and marketing. However, a semi-concious fear of
   failure held me at bay. During my time at Lockheed Martin, that fear
   slowly abated. My experiences have shown that project failures could parlay
   into future successes and that taking on challenges is the best
   avenue for personal growth.

I discussed these lessons with several colleagues and family members over the
last few years. Actions speak louder than words however, and it is now time to act.
Leaving my job reflects my intention to set limits on the accumulation of wealth
and traditional career advancement to focus on my life goal: *Nuture a
healthy, minamalist lifestyle directing attention towards family and
entrepreneurship.*

Objectives
----------

In pursuit of my life goal, I have drafted a few mid-term (3 year) objectives:

1. Establish a balanced exercise, meditation, and nutrtition plan to revitalize
   energy and cultivate mindfulness.
2. Generate semi-passive income covering expenses and savings goals to achieve
   financial freedom.
3. Purchase a new home near family to reconnect and share in the experience of
   a new generation growing up.

Of these three objectives, my blog will focus on #2. Over the next 30 weeks,
I will share my progress as I look to launch a software service and generate
$10K in revenue by year-end. To keep my focus on the business, I will be
limiting myself to a single entry a week describing the objective,
accomplishments, and lessons learned. I welcome you to check in on Sundays or
subscribe for updates via email or RSS feed.
