description: My startup launched today -- 4dashes is a productivity tool that turns your todo list into a game.
---

For those who followed my posts during the beginning of my startup, I have 
launched a preview of the product. 

<!-- more -->

The product, [4dashes][1], is a productivity tool that turns your todo list 
into a game challenging you build effective work habits. Head over now and 
sign up for a preview account. If you like what you see and have an interest 
in working smarter -- not longer -- please consider contributing to the 
Indiegogo [campaign][2]. If the campaign is funded, the product will 
officially launch in June along with incomplete features such as leaderboards.

Unfortunately I was unable to keep up with the blogging during the startup 
period. My time and attention were required on the pressing matter of product 
design and development. With that complete, I will be posting several new 
articles over the next two weeks that summarize why and how I built 4dashes.
